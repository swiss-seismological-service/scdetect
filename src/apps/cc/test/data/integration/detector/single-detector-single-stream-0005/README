Detect multiple events with short interevent time

- Configuration:

  + Test detection to detect two events that occur within 3 seconds.
  + Trigger facilities are enabled. The configured `"triggerDuration"`
  is greater than interevent duration. Therefore, one detection candidate is
  dropped due to a lower score.

- Data and streams:
